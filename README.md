COVID-19 Vaccination Trends- Analysis and Conclusions
Aaron Wood, Danita Charles, Rebekkah Alexander and Barry Maldonado

Project Proposal - Colorado vaccine rates per county, age, manufacturer, and series based on data collected by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment.
The goal of our project is to compare the vaccine rates per county in Colorado from 2020-2023. We will also compare vaccination rates per county, the age ranges(12+, 18+, 65+), 
the year by year vaccination rates by manufacturer, (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, Novavax), and number of doses administered Primary Doses per year vs the Omicron Doses per year per county.


Vaccinations Per County Per Age Ranges
Based on vaccination rates among the age groups 12+, 18+, 65+, the fully vaccinated rates of the smallest counties were closer in percentage amongst the age groups, but only acheived about 
50 to 60 percent full vaccination of the county. A couple of outliers were San Juan and Mineral, each with less than 1000 population fully vaccinated, achieved approximately 90 percent vaccination 
rates in all age groups.


Vaccination Rates Per Manufacturer Per Year
The analysis reveals that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines played a dominant role in the global vaccination effort, with a significant surge in adoption starting in late 2020, corresponding to their emergency use authorizations. This rapid uptake highlights the pivotal role these vaccines had in the early stages of the pandemic response. Additionally, the data uncovers seasonal patterns, with heightened vaccination rates during the winter months, likely driven by public health initiatives aimed at combating increased respiratory illnesses. Spikes in vaccination rates also aligned with the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, reflecting both public concern and swift governmental action to mitigate these threats.

Itâ€™s important to recognize that the dataset contains some gaps, particularly during critical phases of vaccine rollout. These gaps will influence the interpretation of trends, especially when considering regional disparities and the representation of vaccines in the 'Other' category. These limitations suggest that while the data provides valuable insights into vaccine distribution and adoption, further research is needed to fully understand the dynamics at play, particularly in less well-documented regions or for lesser-known vaccines.
