COVID-19 Vaccination Trends- Analysis and Conclusions
Aaron Wood, Danita Charles, Rebekkah Alexander and Barry Maldonado

Project Proposal - Colorado vaccine rates per county, age, manufacturer, and series based on data collected by the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment.
The goal of our project is to compare the vaccine rates per county in Colorado from 2020-2023. We will also compare vaccination rates per county, the age ranges(12+, 18+, 65+), 
the year by year vaccination rates by manufacturer, (Moderna, Pfizer, J&J, Novavax), and number of doses administered Primary Doses per year vs the Omicron Doses per year per county.


Vaccinations Per County Per Age Ranges
Based on vaccination rates among the age groups 12+, 18+, 65+, the fully vaccinated rates of the smallest counties were closer in percentage amongst the age groups, but only acheived about 
50 to 60 percent full vaccination of the county. A couple of outliers were San Juan and Mineral, each with less than 1000 population fully vaccinated, achieved approximately 90 percent vaccination 
rates in all age groups.
