About County Vaccine Rate csvs
The 4 csvs including vaccination rate information for 2020 to 2023 include information on doses administered per county. This includes both vaccines and boosters included in the same counts. Each csv is a cumulative count of doses administered up to that point. Each csv is the last datapoint for that year. The earliest recording the CDPHE had for doses administered by county was 2/19/2021 so part of the 2020 data includes a month and a half of 2021.
